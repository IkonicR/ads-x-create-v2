# Visual Engine Definitions
> **The Core Concept:** 
> *   **The Preset** is the "Guy wearing the suit" (The Subject, The Scene, The Action, The Structure).
> *   **The Style** is the "Color of the suit" (The Lighting, The Filter, The Mood, The Texture).

## Dynamic Administration
Both Presets and Styles are now managed dynamically via the **Admin HQ -> Config** tab.
*   **Images:** Admins can upload reference images for Presets (Composition Guides) and Styles (Vibe Checks).
*   **Logic:** Prompt modifiers can be edited live without code deployment.
