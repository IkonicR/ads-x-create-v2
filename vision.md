# Ads x Create – Product Vision & Strategy

## The Core Problem: "Marketing Schizophrenia"
Small business owners and solopreneurs struggle to maintain a consistent brand identity.
1.  **The Context Gap**: Users constantly re-explaining their business to generic AI tools.
2.  **Brand Drift**: Inconsistent visuals and copy that erode customer trust.
3.  **Blank Page Paralysis**: Knowing they need to post but not knowing where to start.

## The Solution: The Business Operating System

### 1. The "Digital Brain" (Context Persistence)
We categorize businesses immediately to capture relevant data:
*   **Retail/Local**: Focus on "Near me", Hours, Physical Address.
*   **E-Commerce**: Focus on Shipping, "Link in Bio", Global reach.
*   **Service/Consulting**: Focus on "Booking", "Trust", "Expertise".

### 2. The "Brand Director" (Guardrails)
*   **Style Presets**: Curated by the Admin (You). Users select "Minimalist", "Luxury", etc.
*   **The Ban List**: A negative constraint list (e.g., "Never use emojis", "Never say 'Cheap'").
*   **Team Integration**: Users can upload photos of themselves/staff to be composited into AI ads.

### 3. The Admin Dashboard (Your HQ)
*   **Idea Hub**: A dedicated space for the App Owner to track the roadmap and notes.
*   **Style Management**: Where global presets are defined and managed.
*   **User Management**: Invite codes and access control.

## Success Metrics
*   **Time-to-Publish**: Under 60 seconds.
*   **Consistency Score**: Do assets look identical in tone/style over 30 days?
*   **Reuse Rate**: usage of the "Library" assets.
